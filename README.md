Rock, paper, scissors project

Updated RPS project with user interface

Final thoughts:

The original RPS project was not that hard, I managed to make everything work with the console perfectly.

However, when it came to updating it with a user interface, I was racking my brains with what code to remove and update with DOM methods.

I had to rework the project from square 1 starting with HTML first.
After I put all the HTML elements in, I then started working with the JavaScript.

Doing this made it more clear with what I wanted the JavaScript to do in my code.

I think for my first full project, I really struggled with what language to start coding in first and I could not envision with what the final product should look like.

Shoutout to Coding with Rob for helping me with the project!

I'm hoping that for my next project, I'll be able to code mostly by myself.
